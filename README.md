# MagnumIO

This repository is a nexus for application/framework developers who make use of Magnum IO and developers of the various components in the Magnum IO platform.  Its purpose is to accelerate development by sharing open source code, governed by the Apache 2.0 license.  The existing structure provides for samples, tests, building blocks, and more.  

Magnum IO is the IO subsystem of the modern accelerated datacenter.  It pertains to data movement, access, and management.  As described in https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/magnum-io/, it covers network IO, storage IO, compute in the network, and IO management.  

We welcome you to browse the growing body of code here, and to submit your own contributions as PRs.  Signing the license is one of the steps of making a PR.  Over time, a subset of the code here will be functionally validated, and a subset may be performance evaluated.  Not all of the code will be accepted into the mainline, but PRs will still be visible to other developers as an inspiration.

Please find the license file in this repo, along with a file which contains the license-related text that should be included in all source code files.
